# User Input

:::caution
The behavior of `stdin` is controlled by Pyodide, the Python distribution we use, which calls a [`Window.prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) to collect user input and blocks execution on the main thread. This behavior is not currently extensible, as blocking the main thread is a special case and is only allowed for a handful of methods. However, there is active development working toward a solution to this issue and we hope to have `input()` usage patched in the near future.
:::

In the meantime, depending on your use case, you may be able to use the following alternatives to `stdin`.

## User input field

If you're anticipating input from a user, you could render a separate input field for user input and assign the result to a variable in Python:

```tsx
async function run() {
  // Set the input variable in Python
  const code = `name = '${userInput}'

${input}
`

  runPython(code)
}
```

The following example shows this in action. To try it out:

- Enter a value in the input field below, which will set the `userInput` variable
- Run by clicking `Run` which will execute the code in the editor window, with the `name` variable prepended to the code

export const exampleInputCode = `print(f"Hello, {name}!")
`

<Input code={exampleInputCode} />

You can find the source code for this example [here](https://github.com/elilambnz/react-py/blob/main/website/src/components/Input.tsx).

## Override built-in `input()`

You could override the built-in input() function to provide a mock input value:

```python
import builtins

def mock_input(prompt):
    print(prompt)
    return "Name"

builtins.input = mock_input

name = input("Enter your name:")

print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
