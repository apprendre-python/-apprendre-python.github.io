This behavior is not currently extensible, as blocking the main thread is a special case and is only allowed for a handful of methods. However, there is active development working toward a solution to this issue and we hope to have input() usage patched in the near future."},"examples/using-packages":{"id":"examples/using-packages","title":"Using Packages","description":"Packages can be installed using the following Packages object and can be imported either globally through the provider, or per instance.
